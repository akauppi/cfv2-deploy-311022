# Problem #1

This problem doesn't need a scheduled function to be defined.

## Preparation

Comment out these lines in `functions/index.js`:

```
//export const abc = !EMULATION && await import("./abc.js").then( mod => mod.abc() );
//export { abc } from './abc.js'
```

Follow steps in main `README`, to authenticate (and try deploying).

## Steps

```
$ ./deploy.sh
```

### Expected

The script will succeed.

### Actual

```
...
Error: An unexpected error has occurred.
```

The deployment succeeds, but exiting the process fails.

More details are in `firebase-debug.log`:

```
$ tail -n 40 firebase-debug.log
...

It should not be a problem for `firebase-tools`, to be run under Docker (Alpine Linux image) and the log file having been mapped to host.

**Work-around:**

If one enables/disables the `firebase-debug.log` mapping in `docker-compose.yml` on a case-by-case basis, one can debug problems (line enabled) or deploy (line disabled).

This is, however, very clumsy in practise.


## Why this matters?

It may be rare for people to deploy from a sandbox, but it's not an unreasonable use case.

In this case, it's about onboarding new users to a repo, so they can be up and running as early as possible - doing first deployments without needing to set up CI/CD for it.
