Firebase "v2" Cloud Functions are in public preview (Oct 2022). This is a repo to try to make a scheduled function deploy, from within Docker Compose.

<!--
Bugs noticed:

- ["[Beta] `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'service')`, deploying a scheduled function (v2)"](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-functions/issues/1293)
--> 

## Requirements

- You have a Firebase project created, with Cloud Functions enabled (requires "Blaze" plan)

   >Google Analytics can be disabled.

- Docker Desktop installed, and running
- Node.js 16 or 18, `npm` 8

<!--
The repo is developed on macOS, but there shouldn't be anything OS specific.
-->

```
$ ./deploy.sh 
```

On the first run, you will be authenticated, to be able to deploy the project.

>Note: In this repo, the authentication is kept around for later runs (in `.state/`), so you'll need to do the authentication only once.

Next: 

- choose the project
- give it a compulsory alias (`_` will do)

```
? Which project do you want to add? abc-3011
? What alias do you want to use for this project? (e.g. staging) _

Created alias _ for abc-3011.
Now using alias _ (abc-3011)
```

```
